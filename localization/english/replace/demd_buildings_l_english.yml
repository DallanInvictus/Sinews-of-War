 building_barracks_07_desc:1 "$demd_building_manpower_07_yes$\n\n By constructing dedicated conscription centers in all nearby villages, we ensure a steady stream of ill-willed, alcoholized troublemakers to swell our ranks."

 building_camel_farms_07_desc:1 "$demd_building_manpower_07_yes$\n\n Making armor for camels is not an easy task, but the reward is well worth it. A charge by fearsome fully-armored camels can make any horse-based army turn their tail and flee."
